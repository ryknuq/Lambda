### A Message from me

> This project is free and will always remain free. I want to go open source as well. The only way this is gonna survive is if I get support, in terms of mainly testing, suggestions and sometimes even developer help. When it gets dire, I mainly need someone to even to test the thing.

This project was born out of a passion for the game and its HVH community. By making it open source, the goal is to create a transparent, collaborative, and powerful tool that can be shaped by its users. We are not interested in monetary gain; we are interested in building something great together.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This software is intended for educational purposes and for use on community servers that explicitly allow this kind of gameplay (HVH servers). Using this cheat in official matchmaking or on any server where it is forbidden will almost certainly result in a permanent ban (VAC, Game BAN, etc.). The developers and contributors are not responsible for any bans or other consequences that may result from your use or misuse of this software. **You use this at your own risk.**

### Project History & Credits

This project stands on the shoulders of giants. **Lambda** is based on the source code of **Divine**, which itself was based on **Legendware v3**.

A huge amount of credit and thanks goes to the original developers of those projects. Their foundational work has made this project possible, and we aim to honor their efforts by continuing to build upon it in a free and open-source manner for the community.

### Features
